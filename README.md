Project Overview:
This C++ project demonstrates comprehensive file handling techniques, including reading from and writing to files, managing file operations, and handling errors. It provides practical examples of file manipulation to illustrate effective data management in C++.
Key Features:
File Operations:
Reading Files: Implemented functionality to open, read, and parse data from text files. Handles various file formats and structures.
Writing Files: Developed methods to create, write, and append data to files. Supports writing formatted output and managing file content.
File Management: Includes operations such as checking if a file exists, deleting files, and renaming files.
Error Handling:
File Open Errors: Implemented error handling for cases where files cannot be opened, including handling exceptions and providing user feedback.
File Read/Write Errors: Managed errors during reading and writing operations to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages.
Practical Examples:
Data Storage: Demonstrated saving and retrieving structured data, such as user records or configuration settings, using file I/O operations.
Log Files: Implemented logging functionality to record events or errors, showcasing how to handle log file creation and updates.
User Interaction:
Command-line interface for performing file operations. Users can interact with the program to test various file handling features.
